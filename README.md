# Travellers-City-Explorer-Android-App
An increase in number of foreigners in China who enjoy travelling around to enjoy themselves, has resulted in them needing a platform that can help them in exploring places by viewing sceneries in some cities worthy visiting that many are not familiar with.  As a solution a mobile application was created focusing on delivering information of three cities in China, namely Jinhua, Chengdu and Hangzhou with various features added to it such as the google map, camera and a timer. Security features were added to the application as it requires users to sign in to access the system using SQLite database in the back-end. For the city exploring, the system makes use of adapters connecting list views and the data source. Also, the camera feature used the intent for its functionality and bitmap for processing the pictures for display. The application also uses GPS as the location provider by using the Google Maps API rather than using the Android’s network location provider to find the user’s location. The timer feature was added that uses a thread handler instead of using services.
